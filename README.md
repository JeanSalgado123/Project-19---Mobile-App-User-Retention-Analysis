# Data Science Project: User Retention Analysis

## Project Description
This project simulates a user retention analysis in a mobile app. The goal is to identify patterns of user retention, segment users, and predict retention likelihood.

## Objectives
- Analyze user retention patterns.
- Train a classification model to predict user retention.
- Provide visual insights into user behavior.

## Methodology
- The dataset is simulated to represent user interactions, including variables such as session count, days since last session, notification clicks, and feedback scores.
- A Random Forest Classifier is used to predict user retention.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC curve.

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have all dependencies installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `fpdf`, `joblib`).
2. Run the provided Python scripts to generate visualizations, train models, and create a detailed PDF report.
3. Review the generated files in their respective folders (e.g., visualizations, reports, etc.).

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, fpdf, joblib

## Results
- The project provides insights into user behavior and factors influencing retention.
- The trained model achieves satisfactory accuracy in predicting user retention.

## Conclusions and Recommendations
- Enhancing notification strategies and increasing session engagement are key factors for improving retention.
- Further analysis with real-world data can validate and refine the current model.

## Next Steps
- Implement the predictive model within the app for real-time insights.
- Test new engagement strategies based on the findings of this analysis.
